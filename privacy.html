            <p>Clear Gifs</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              We and our or our third party advertising partner employ a
              software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web
              Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing
              us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a
              unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to
              track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies,
              which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are
              embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the
              period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information
              gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable
              information.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which
              emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the
              effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of
              our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these
              emails, please see "Communications From The Site."

            <p>Log Files</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              As is true of most Web sites, we use third-party tracking services
              to gather certain information automatically and store it in log
              files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,
              browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
              pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              We use this information, which does not identify individual users,
              to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users'
              movements around the site and to gather demographic information
              about our user base as a whole.

              Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to
              identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site,
              the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability
